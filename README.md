### Hi there 👋, I'm Alex 🚀
#### Who I am?
I'm tech engineer, with a broad experience working in e-commerce, streaming services, and digital retail. I live in the Netherlands 🇳🇱. I'm an stoic apprentice, strongly adicted to books and feeding my brain (and soul?) with knowledge, philosophy and learning how to live a better life with the maximum virtue that I can achieve. I'm just a simple human aware of my own ignorance. 🧖‍

#### What I usually do?
- 👨‍💻 Mostly platform engineering, Developer Experience, and I love OSS ❤️
- 💰 Indie Hacker
- 🚀 CTO of [IdeaUP](www.ideaup.cl)

And the most important duty! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Father of two amazingly beautiful lives (Catalina & Alexander) and husband full time!

#### Where you can find me?
- 🙋🏻‍♂️I don't have social networks (twitter, facebook, instagram or similar), the only one that I have is Linkedin for proffessional purposes.
